<h2>How to Play Comparison Numerical</h2>
    
<h3>Step 1</h3>
<p>Each question presents you with a set of comparisons between different items. For example:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comparison 1:</strong> Sea is less than Pyramid</li>
    <li><strong>Comparison 2:</strong> Sea is more than Turtle</li>
    <li><strong>Comparison 3:</strong> Wrist is less than Turtle</li>
    <li><strong>Comparison 4:</strong> Pyramid is more than Turtle</li>
</ul>
<p>These comparisons provide the relational framework needed to evaluate a conclusion.</p>

<h3>Step 2</h3>
<p>The key to solving these questions is understanding how the items relate to each other based on the given comparisons. Letâ€™s break down the example:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Sea &lt; Pyramid:</strong> The Sea is smaller (or less) than the Pyramid.</li>
    <li><strong>Sea &gt; Turtle:</strong> The Sea is larger (or more) than the Turtle.</li>
    <li><strong>Wrist &lt; Turtle:</strong> The Wrist is smaller (or less) than the Turtle.</li>
    <li><strong>Pyramid &gt; Turtle:</strong> The Pyramid is larger (or more) than the Turtle.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 3</h3>
<p>You will need to determine if a new comparison or conclusion is logically valid based on the relationships given. For example:</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> "Wrist is less than Sea."</p>
<p>To evaluate this conclusion, consider the chain of relationships:</p>
<p>Since Sea is more than Turtle and Wrist is less than Turtle, it logically follows that Wrist is less than Sea.</p>

<h3>Step 4</h3>
<p>After analyzing the relationships:</p>
<ul>
    <li>If the conclusion logically follows from the given comparisons, click the <strong>True</strong> button.</li>
    <li>If the conclusion does not logically follow, click the <strong>False</strong> button.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the example provided:</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> "Wrist is less than Sea."</p>
<p>Based on the comparisons (Wrist &lt; Turtle &lt; Sea), this conclusion would be <strong>True</strong>.</p>
<p>After submitting your answer, the game will provide feedback on whether your choice was correct, helping you learn and improve your ability to evaluate numerical comparisons.</p>

<h3>Tips for Success</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Map it out:</strong> Sometimes it helps to visualize the relationships in a linear order or hierarchy.</li>
    <li><strong>Consider all premises:</strong> Ensure that your conclusion is consistent with all the given comparisons.</li>
    <li><strong>Practice and patience:</strong> With practice, you'll improve your ability to quickly analyze and draw accurate conclusions.</li>
</ul>
