    <p>Studies have provided compelling evidence linking cognitive enhancement to relational training based on <strong>Relational Frame Theory (RFT)</strong>. RFT is a psychological theory of human language and cognition that posits the ability to mentally relate things in abstract ways as foundational to higher cognitive processes such as language, problem-solving, and learning.</p>
    <p>These findings offer a promising avenue for educational and psychological interventions aimed at boosting intellectual functioning. The implications are profound, suggesting that cognitive abilities can be significantly and deliberately enhanced through well-structured relational training programs, potentially leading to better educational outcomes and more effective problem-solving skills in everyday life.</p>
