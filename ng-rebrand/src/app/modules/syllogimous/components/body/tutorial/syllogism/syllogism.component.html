<h2>How to Play Syllogism</h2>
<p>Syllogism-type questions are logical puzzles where you must determine if a conclusion logically follows from a set of given premises. Here’s how to play:</p>

<h3>Step 1</h3>
<p>Each syllogism question starts with a set of premises. A premise is a statement that you assume to be true. For example:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Premise 1:</strong> Some Planet is Soup</li>
    <li><strong>Premise 2:</strong> No Freezer is Turtle</li>
    <li><strong>Premise 3:</strong> No Freezer is Planet</li>
    <li><strong>Premise 4:</strong> All Turtle is Planet</li>
</ul>
<p>These premises form the basis of the logic puzzle.</p>

<h3>Step 2</h3>
<p>The game will present a conclusion that you must evaluate based on the premises. The conclusion might not always be explicitly provided; instead, you may infer it based on the premises. For example, you might be asked to evaluate the following conclusion:</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> "Some Freezer is Soup."</p>

<h3>Step 3</h3>
<p>To determine whether the conclusion is true or false, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Examine the relationships</strong> defined by the premises. For instance, "No Freezer is Planet" and "No Freezer is Turtle" suggest that Freezer is entirely separate from both Planet and Turtle.</li>
    <li><strong>Check consistency</strong> with the conclusion. In the example conclusion "Some Freezer is Soup," see if this is logically possible given the relationships in the premises.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Step 4</h3>
<p>Once you’ve analyzed the premises and the conclusion, click the <strong>True</strong> button if you believe the conclusion logically follows from the premises, or the <strong>False</strong> button if it does not.</p>
<p>For example, based on the premises provided:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Since "No Freezer is Planet" and "No Freezer is Turtle," and "All Turtle is Planet," we can deduce that a Freezer cannot be Soup if Soup is a Planet or Turtle. Thus, the conclusion "Some Freezer is Soup" would be <strong>False</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>After you make your choice, the game will inform you whether you were correct or incorrect, helping you learn and improve your logical reasoning skills.</p>

<p>Whenever you encounter a phrase highlighted in <span class="is-negated">red</span>, it's an indication that you need to think inversely about the information presented.</p>

<h3>Tips for Success</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Take your time:</strong> Carefully read and analyze each premise before making a decision.</li>
    <li><strong>Practice makes perfect:</strong> The more you play, the better you'll get at recognizing valid conclusions.</li>
</ul>

<p>By following these steps, you’ll be able to master syllogism questions and sharpen your logical reasoning abilities!</p>
