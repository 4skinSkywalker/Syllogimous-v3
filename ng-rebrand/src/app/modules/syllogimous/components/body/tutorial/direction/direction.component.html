<h2>How to Play Direction</h2>

<h3>Step 1</h3>
<p>Each question will present a series of directional relationships. These premises describe where one object is located in relation to another. For example:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Premise 1:</strong> Jewelry is at East of Color</li>
    <li><strong>Premise 2:</strong> Tail is at West of Milk</li>
    <li><strong>Premise 3:</strong> Color is at South-East of Tail</li>
    <li><strong>Premise 4:</strong> Milk is at South-East of Jewelry</li>
</ul>
<p>These premises establish the spatial relationships between the different objects.</p>

<h3>Step 2</h3>
<p>To solve the puzzle, you need to mentally (or physically) map out the positions of each object based on the given premises.</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Start with a base reference:</strong> Choose one object to start with. For example, place "Tail" in your mental map or on paper.</li>
    <li><strong>Place the related objects:</strong> According to the premises:
        <ul>
            <li>If "Tail is at West of Milk," then place "Milk" to the right (east) of "Tail."</li>
            <li>"Color is at South-East of Tail," so "Color" should be below and to the right of "Tail."</li>
            <li>"Jewelry is at East of Color," so "Jewelry" should be directly to the right of "Color."</li>
            <li>"Milk is at South-East of Jewelry," meaning "Milk" is positioned below and to the right of "Jewelry."</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>

<h3>Step 3</h3>
<p>Once you have a clear map of the objects, check the consistency of their relationships according to the premises. For example, confirm that "Milk" is indeed south-east of "Jewelry" and that "Jewelry" is correctly placed east of "Color."</p>

<h3>Step 4</h3>
<p>Based on the spatial arrangement you've mapped out, you might be asked to determine the validity of a specific directional statement. If the question provides a new statement like "Jewelry is north of Tail," you would compare it against your mental map.</p>
<p>If your map shows that "Jewelry" is not north of "Tail" but rather to its east, you would click <strong>False</strong>. If the statement matches your map, click <strong>True</strong>.</p>
<p>After selecting either <strong>True</strong> or <strong>False</strong>, the game will indicate whether your choice was correct. This helps reinforce your understanding of spatial relationships and improve your problem-solving skills.</p>

<h3>The <span class="is-negated">Negation</span> Cue</h3>
<p>Whenever you encounter a phrase highlighted in <span class="is-negated">red</span>, it's an indication that you need to think inversely about the information presented.</p>

<h3>Tips for Success</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Draw it out:</strong> If you find it challenging to visualize the positions, draw them on paper to keep track of the objects and their relationships.</li>
    <li><strong>Double-check your map:</strong> Before making your final choice, review the entire map to ensure accuracy.</li>
</ul>

<p>By following these steps, you'll enhance your ability to solve direction-type questions, making you better at spatial reasoning and logical thinking.</p>
