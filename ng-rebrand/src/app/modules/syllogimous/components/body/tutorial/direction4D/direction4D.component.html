<h2>How to Play Direction4D</h2>
<p>Direction4D is a complex logical puzzle where you need to consider both spatial directions and the timing of events to determine the relationship between different entities. Here's how you can approach these questions:</p>

<h3>Step 1</h3>
<p>Each question provides a series of statements that describe the positions of different entities relative to each other in both space and time. For example:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Statement 1:</strong> Taxi was Below and West of Dentist</li>
    <li><strong>Statement 2:</strong> Dentist is North of Woman</li>
    <li><strong>Statement 3:</strong> Woman was Above and South-West of Shark</li>
    <li><strong>Statement 4:</strong> Shark was West of Taxi</li>
</ul>
<p>These statements describe spatial relationships with directional terms (e.g., West, North, Above) and include temporal aspects (e.g., "was").</p>

<h3>Step 2</h3>
<p>To solve the puzzle, you need to mentally map out the positions of the entities. Start by sketching or imagining their relative positions:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Taxi and Dentist:</strong> The Taxi is Below and West of the Dentist. This places the Dentist somewhere North-East of the Taxi.</li>
    <li><strong>Dentist and Woman:</strong> The Dentist is North of the Woman. So, the Woman is directly South of the Dentist.</li>
    <li><strong>Woman and Shark:</strong> The Woman was Above and South-West of the Shark. This places the Shark below and slightly North-East of the Woman.</li>
    <li><strong>Shark and Taxi:</strong> The Shark was West of the Taxi. This puts the Taxi East of the Shark.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 3</h3>
<p>The temporal phrases like "was" indicate that a subject should be considered in its past position, without any change in spatial location over time. Consider this when assessing the overall positions:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The use of "was" suggests that positions may not be current but were true at a specific time in the past.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 4</h3>
<p>Now, evaluate the conclusion or question based on the relationships you have mapped out. For example, if asked:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> "Is it possible that the Shark is now North of the Dentist?"</li>
</ul>
<p>To answer:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Analyze:</strong> Given the initial positions, the Shark was to the West of the Taxi, and the Taxi was Below and West of the Dentist. The Dentist is North of the Woman, and the Woman was Above and South-West of the Shark.</li>
    <li><strong>Evaluate:</strong> It’s unlikely that the Shark could be North of the Dentist based on these relative positions.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 5</h3>
<p>Based on your analysis, decide whether the given conclusion is True or False. Click the <strong>True</strong> button if the conclusion logically follows, or <strong>False</strong> if it does not.</p>
<p>In this case, the conclusion "Shark is now North of Dentist" would likely be <strong>False</strong> based on the original statements.</p>

<h3>The <span class="is-negated">Negation</span> Cue</h3>
<p>Whenever you encounter a phrase highlighted in <span class="is-negated">red</span>, it's an indication that you need to think inversely about the information presented.</p>

<h3>Tips for Success</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Draw a diagram:</strong> If the relationships are complex, drawing them out can help clarify.</li>
    <li><strong>Consider the temporal aspect:</strong> Remember that "was" implies a temporal relationship without affecting the spatial one; therefore, the position should be considered as if it hasn't changed.</li>
    <li><strong>Double-check relationships:</strong> Ensure that all entities’ positions align logically with each other before making your decision.</li>
</ul>

<p>By carefully analyzing both the spatial and temporal elements, you can master Direction4D questions and improve your multidimensional reasoning skills!</p>
