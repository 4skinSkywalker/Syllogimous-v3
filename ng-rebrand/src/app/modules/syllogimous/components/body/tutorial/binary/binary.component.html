<h2>How to Play Binary</h2>
<p>In the binary type questions, you need to evaluate whether a specific logical statement (or set of statements) is true or false based on the relationships given. These questions often involve comparing elements or determining relationships between them using logical operators like <strong>same as</strong>, <strong>opposite of</strong>, and <strong>or</strong>.</p>

<h3>Step 1</h3>
<p>Each binary question starts with a set of relationships between different items. Here’s an example:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Statement 1:</strong> Jaw is same as Foot</li>
    <li><strong>Statement 2:</strong> Foot is opposite of Barbie</li>
    <li><strong>Statement 3:</strong> No Violin is Cashier</li>
    <li><strong>Statement 4:</strong> All Violin is Paint</li>
    <li><strong>Statement 5:</strong> Jaw is same as Barbie</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Binary Question:</strong> "Jaw is same as Barbie <em>or</em> No Cashier is Paint"</p>

<h3>Step 2</h3>
<p>To solve the binary question, analyze the relationships described in each statement:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Statement 1:</strong> "Jaw is same as Foot" means that whatever is true of the Jaw should also be true of the Foot.</li>
    <li><strong>Statement 2:</strong> "Foot is opposite of Barbie" means that the characteristics of Foot are entirely different from Barbie.</li>
    <li><strong>Statement 3:</strong> "No Violin is Cashier" suggests that Violin and Cashier do not overlap in any way.</li>
    <li><strong>Statement 4:</strong> "All Violin is Paint" indicates that every Violin is also classified as Paint.</li>
    <li><strong>Statement 5:</strong> "Jaw is same as Barbie" contradicts Statement 2, since if Jaw is the same as Foot, and Foot is opposite of Barbie, Jaw cannot logically be the same as Barbie.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 3</h3>
<p>Now, consider the binary question:</p>
<blockquote><strong>Binary Question:</strong> "Jaw is same as Barbie <em>or</em> No Cashier is Paint"</blockquote>
<p>This question uses the logical operator <strong>or</strong>, meaning that the entire statement is true if <strong>either</strong> "Jaw is same as Barbie" <strong>or</strong> "No Cashier is Paint" is true.</p>
<ul>
    <li>From the analysis, "Jaw is same as Barbie" should be false because it contradicts the earlier statements.</li>
    <li>"No Cashier is Paint" might be true, based on the third and fourth statements, but we need to confirm.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the binary question requires only one part of the statement to be true for the entire statement to be true, if you determine "No Cashier is Paint" is true, then the answer to the binary question would be <strong>True</strong>.</p>

<h3>Step 4</h3>
<p>After analyzing, click the <strong>True</strong> button if you believe the binary question is logically correct, or the <strong>False</strong> button if you believe it is not.</p>
<p>After making your choice, you’ll receive feedback on whether your answer was correct, helping you understand the logical structure better.</p>

<p>Whenever you encounter a phrase highlighted in <span class="is-negated">red</span>, it's an indication that you need to think inversely about the information presented.</p>

<h3>Tips for Success</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Carefully evaluate contradictions:</strong> Pay close attention to any potential contradictions in the statements.</li>
    <li><strong>Use logical operators wisely:</strong> Understand how "or," "and," and other operators affect the truth value of statements.</li>
</ul>

<p>By following these steps, you can master binary type questions, enhancing your ability to reason through complex logical puzzles.</p>
