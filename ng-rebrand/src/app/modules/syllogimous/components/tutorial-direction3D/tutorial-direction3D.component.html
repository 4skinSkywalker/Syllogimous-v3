<h2>How to Play Direction3D</h2>
<p>Direction3D questions are spatial reasoning puzzles where you must determine the relative positions of different objects in a 3D space based on given statements. Hereâ€™s how you can play:</p>

<h3>Step 1</h3>
<p>Each Direction3D question presents a set of spatial relationships between different objects. For example:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Statement 1:</strong> Temple is Above and West of Luggage</li>
    <li><strong>Statement 2:</strong> Luggage is South of Governor</li>
    <li><strong>Statement 3:</strong> Hotel is North-East of Temple</li>
    <li><strong>Statement 4:</strong> Governor is Below of Hotel</li>
</ul>
<p>These statements describe the positions of objects relative to one another in three-dimensional space.</p>

<h3>Step 2</h3>
<p>To solve the puzzle, try to mentally visualize or sketch the positions of the objects based on the given statements:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Temple</strong> is positioned <strong>Above</strong> and <strong>West</strong> of <strong>Luggage</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>Luggage</strong> is positioned <strong>South</strong> of <strong>Governor</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>Hotel</strong> is positioned <strong>North-East</strong> of <strong>Temple</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>Governor</strong> is positioned <strong>Below</strong> <strong>Hotel</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 3</h3>
<p>After understanding each object's relative position, you may be asked to verify a specific relationship between two or more objects. For example:</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> "Is the Hotel above the Governor?"</p>
<p>Based on the given statements:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Hotel</strong> is North-East of <strong>Temple</strong>, and <strong>Governor</strong> is Below <strong>Hotel</strong>.</li>
    <li>Therefore, <strong>Hotel</strong> should indeed be above <strong>Governor</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 4</h3>
<p>Based on your analysis, click the <strong>True</strong> button if you believe the given relationship is correct or the <strong>False</strong> button if you think it is not.</p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<p>If the game asks if "Hotel is above the Governor," you would select <strong>True</strong> based on the reasoning above.</p>
<p>After making your choice, the game will confirm whether you were correct or not, helping you refine your spatial reasoning skills.</p>

<h3>Tips for Success</h3>
<p><strong>Use a mental map:</strong> Visualize or draw a simple sketch to track the positions of each object.</p>
<p><strong>Consider all dimensions:</strong> Remember that positions can change along multiple axes (north-south, east-west, above-below).</p>
