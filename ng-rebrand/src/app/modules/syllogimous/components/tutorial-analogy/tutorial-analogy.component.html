<h2>How to Play Analogy</h2>
    
<h3>Step 1</h3>
<p>Each analogy question begins with a set of statements that define the relationships between different items. For example:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Statement 1:</strong> Brush is the same as Desk</li>
    <li><strong>Statement 2:</strong> Desk is opposite of Bread</li>
    <li><strong>Statement 3:</strong> Skirt is opposite of Heart</li>
    <li><strong>Statement 4:</strong> Bread is the same as Skirt</li>
</ul>
<p>These statements provide the groundwork for understanding how each item relates to the others.</p>

<h3>Step 2</h3>
<p>After reviewing the relationships, you'll be presented with an analogy that you need to evaluate. For example:</p>
<p><strong>Analogy to Evaluate:</strong> "Heart to Bread is the same as Skirt to Desk."</p>
<p>Your task is to determine whether the relationship between "Heart and Bread" is equivalent to the relationship between "Skirt and Desk."</p>

<h3>Step 3</h3>
<p>To solve the analogy, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Identify the relationships</strong> between the items in each pair.
        <ul>
            <li>From Statement 3: "Skirt is opposite of Heart."</li>
            <li>From Statement 4: "Bread is the same as Skirt."</li>
            <li>From Statement 2: "Desk is opposite of Bread."</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Map the relationships</strong> to the analogy:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>"Heart to Bread":</strong> Since "Bread is the same as Skirt" and "Skirt is opposite of Heart," the relationship here is one of opposition.</li>
            <li><strong>"Skirt to Desk":</strong> Since "Bread is the same as Skirt" and "Desk is opposite of Bread," the relationship here is also one of opposition.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Determine consistency:</strong> Both "Heart to Bread" and "Skirt to Desk" have an "opposite" relationship. Therefore, the analogy is consistent.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Step 4</h3>
<p>After analyzing the relationships, you need to decide whether the analogy holds true:</p>
<ul>
    <li>If the relationships match, click <strong>True</strong>.</li>
    <li>If they do not match, click <strong>False</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this example, since both pairs have an opposite relationship, you would select <strong>True</strong>.</p>
<p>Once you've made your selection, the game will give you feedback, helping you to learn from your choices and improve your ability to recognize patterns in analogies.</p>

<h3>Tips for Success</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Break down the relationships:</strong> Focus on one pair at a time to avoid confusion.</li>
    <li><strong>Practice regularly:</strong> Familiarity with different types of relationships will help you solve analogies more quickly and accurately.</li>
</ul>

<p>By following these steps, you'll be better equipped to tackle analogy questions, improving your pattern recognition and logical reasoning skills!</p>
