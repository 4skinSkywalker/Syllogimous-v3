<h1>Distinction Questions</h1>
<p>Distinction-type questions challenge your ability to analyze relationships between different items based on whether they are the same or opposite. Here’s a guide on how to approach these questions:</p>

<h2>Step 1</h2>
<p>Distinction questions begin with a set of premises that define the relationships between various items. These premises will tell you whether items are the same or opposite. For example:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Premise 1:</strong> Mango is the same as Glass</li>
    <li><strong>Premise 2:</strong> Herbs is the same as Mango</li>
    <li><strong>Premise 3:</strong> Glass is the same as Shower</li>
    <li><strong>Premise 4:</strong> Herbs is opposite of Shower</li>
</ul>
<p>These premises set up the relationships you need to consider.</p>

<h2>Step 2</h2>
<p>Your goal is to understand how the items relate to each other based on the provided premises. Follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Identify direct relationships:</strong> Start by connecting items that are directly related. For example:
        <ul>
            <li>"Mango is the same as Glass"</li>
            <li>"Herbs is the same as Mango"</li>
            <li>"Glass is the same as Shower"</li>
        </ul>
        This means Mango, Glass, and Shower are all the same. Since "Herbs is the same as Mango," Herbs should also be the same as Glass and Shower.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Consider opposing relationships:</strong> Next, look at the premise that introduces an opposition:
        <ul>
            <li>"Herbs is opposite of Shower"</li>
        </ul>
        Here, despite Herbs being the same as Mango, Glass, and Shower, it’s also stated to be opposite to Shower.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 3</h2>
<p>Based on your analysis, the game might ask you to evaluate a statement like:</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> "Mango is opposite of Shower."</p>
<p>You need to decide if this conclusion logically follows from the premises. Since Mango is the same as Shower (from the premises), the conclusion "Mango is opposite of Shower" would be <strong>False</strong>.</p>

<h2>Step 4</h2>
<p>After your analysis, select <strong>True</strong> if you believe the conclusion follows from the premises or <strong>False</strong> if it does not.</p>
<p>In our example, you would select <strong>False</strong> because Mango, Glass, and Shower are all stated to be the same, making it impossible for Mango to be opposite of Shower.</p>
<p>The game will provide immediate feedback, letting you know whether your choice was correct. Use this feedback to improve your understanding of how distinctions are made in logical reasoning.</p>

<h2>Tips for Success</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Look for contradictions:</strong> If an item is stated to be the same as one and opposite of another, look for possible contradictions to determine the correct conclusion.</li>
    <li><strong>Map relationships:</strong> Visually or mentally map out the relationships to better understand how each item connects.</li>
</ul>

<p>By following this method, you'll be well-prepared to tackle distinction-type questions, enhancing your ability to navigate complex logical relationships.</p>
